# Specification Quality Checklist: SyncPlay Cast Target

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-10-12
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Seat-transfer model (TV replaces sender; sender is a pure remote) confirmed
  by the user in /speckit-clarify, 2026-10-12.
- Whether the receiver authenticates as its own session or is driven by the
  sender is a plan-phase question; the spec states only the observable result.
- 2026-10-12 (plan phase): spec amended after research showed the server cannot
  control a stock receiver through the sender; see Clarifications and
  research.md. FR-012/FR-013 added, SC-001/SC-002 retargeted for a cast seat.
